# Neo Framework Alpha 1

# Prerequisites

- Before cloning, make sure you have installed Blender and Unity3D. Blender is
only needed for the demo.
- After cloning, install Photon P.U.N 2. If you don't have Photon you'll get
endless compile errors.
- To run the demo or anything, you'll need an account with Photon, and an app
id (free; check instructions on the Photon website).

# What is this?

Neo is a Unity3D/C# framework for multi/single player/non-player agents.
- Dead simple, modular ability concept (walk, grab, expel, ingest, push, ...)
- Motors and rotors make it suitable for bipeds, quadrupeds, birds and crawlers
- Realtime scripting support (working proof of concept)
- Photon support

Neo is concise (<1kloc by semi-colon count) and (in the right hands) effective.
It provides a clear, readable base that a game project can build on quickly,
whether going with modular/extensible constructs or hacking away.

Note: in the alpha version, Photon is required even if you're doing single
player stuff.

# Why now?

This is an alpha version which is mainly intended at demonstrating my starting
point for Ludum Dare 44. This isn't intended for production use but you're
welcome to look around, run the demo and more generally do whatever you want
with this.
This version is *free* and *open source*.

# Note

For licensing reasons there's no demo showcasing quadrupeds, birds or other
animated models. If you need this stuff, open an issue.
